## Application Description:
We release the source code of this web-based detection system, **Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia Scanner**, to automatically identify the template-translated articles on the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia edition. We publically host this application on Streamlit Community Cloud, here: [https://egyptian-wikipedia-scanner.streamlit.app](https://egyptian-wikipedia-scanner.streamlit.app/), and for better accessibility, we also host it on Hugging Face Spaces, here: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/SaiedAlshahrani/Egyptian-Wikipedia-Scanner](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SaiedAlshahrani/Egyptian-Wikipedia-Scanner).

This web-based application is introduced in a research paper titled "[***Leveraging Corpus Metadata to Detect Template-based Translation: An Exploratory Case Study of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia Edition***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00565)", which is **accepted** at [LREC-COLING 2024](https://lrec-coling-2024.org/): [The 6th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Processing Tools (OSACT6)](https://osact-lrec.github.io/), and is currently released under an MIT license.

## Application Features:
This web-based application, **Egyptian Wikipedia Scanner**, allows users to search for an article directly or select a suggested article retrieved using fuzzy search from the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia edition. The application automatically fetches the articleâ€™s metadata (using the Wikimedia [XTools API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/XTools)), displays the fetched metadata in a table, and automatically classifies the article as `human-generated` or `template-translated`. The application also dynamically displays the full summary of the article and provides the URL to the article to read the full text, as shown in the screenshots below.

## Application Datasets:
We also release the heuristically filtered, manually processed, and automatically classified Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia articles dataset (balanced subset) that has been used to train and test this web-based application, **Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia Scanner**, on Hugging Face Hub, here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/SaiedAlshahrani/Detect-Egyptian-Wikipedia-Articles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SaiedAlshahrani/Detect-Egyptian-Wikipedia-Articles), and is also currently released under an MIT license.
